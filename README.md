#jonasbronson.com

This is the first website that I have published on the internet, complete with a bit of a portfolio of my video production work. Written completely in HTML and CSS, the site is basic, but uses CSS Animations, many graphics, styles, and more. This project taught me a lot about front-end web design, and especially how to more effectively use CSS. I plan to release an updated version with a coding portfolio as well in the future.
